#wakeyGramps 

🕰️👴🏼

A small program, to solve a small problem.

My kids are constantly asking me if grandma/grandpa are awake and because we live in a different time zone, this question makes sense.

Micropython running on a Pico W to check the time in ABQ New Mexico.

If it is after 9am the Pico will display a green light. If not, a solid red light.

## Development Checklist
- [ ] Fix Wi-Fi connection handling
- [ ] Improve time zone calculation to account for daylight savings and leap year
- [ ] Add more LED status indicators
- [ ] Create better error handling
- [ ] Add 8 Leds to show hours remaining before 9am ABQ time
- [ ] Add project setup documentation (circuit diagram for Pico)
- [ ] Add deepsleep mode to conserve power
