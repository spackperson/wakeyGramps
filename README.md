# wakeyGramps

A small program, to solve a small problem.

My kids are constantly asking me if grandma/grandpa are awake and because we live in a different time zone, this question makes sense.

Micropython running on a Pico W to check the time in ABQ New Mexico.

If it is after 9am the Pico will display a blinking green light. If not, a solid red light.

Yurp.
